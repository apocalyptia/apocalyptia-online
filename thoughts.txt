- Maybe Luck is rolled at character creator. 1d6. And that is just how lucky the character is. Has nothing to do with Demeanor. For balancing Traits, add Demeanor to Initiative formula?

- Pulled Blow: Maneuver you declare before rolling your MATK. On a hit, you halve your DMG bonus from Success.

- Initiative: If Init can Explode, maybe it can also Botch? Lost your turn if you Botch an Init roll? Too brutal?

- Health: Maybe Health should be paired down to C x 2?
