- Maybe Luck is rolled at character creation. 1d6. And that is just how lucky the character is. Has nothing to do with Demeanor. For balancing Traits, add Demeanor to Initiative formula?

- Adaptive Skill Points: Normal Skill points are permanent once assigned. You have Adaptive Skill points = Brains as additional Skill points that can be moved around at a rate of 1 per week. This replaces the current Floating Skills rules. Also, remove Floating Traits. Normal Skill Points = B x 3. Adaptive Skill Points = B x 3. Maybe 5 and 6 cost more? Maybe Adaptive Skills only = B x 1?
