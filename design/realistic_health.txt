5Lt = full
@4Lt = start having problems
@2.5Lt = unconscious, probably die

* tourniquets can be on for a few hours without problems

? weapon damage creates a wound (which starts bleeding) and sets difficulty to seal wound ?

? kill spots = brain, cervical spine, heart

? Lung wounds also cause suffocation

? Wounds in any other location are degrees of bleeding

* First-Aid can stop bleeding within a couple of rounds but it could take a few minutes to complete, otherwise bleeding starts again.

* Blood loss causes "hypovolemic shock"

* Bleed out in 30-60sec for major artery (10-20 rnds)

* keep weapon dmg and armor/cover dr where those values are for now! (ish?)

dmg applied is a wound w/ a bleeding rate that == DMG. what is that formula?

6Lt = full
4Lt = problems
2.5Lt = unconscious

-- Classes of Blood Loss --

Class 1 Blood Loss:
0-15%, minimal changes

Class 2 Blood Loss:
15-30%, anxiety/restless

Class 3 Blood Loss:
30-40%, pale/cold/confused

Class 4 Blood Loss:
>40%, severe weakness/confusion/will be lethal without immediate intervention


* Blood donation takes ~1pt which is ~.5Lt (~10% body volume)

* Body regenerates about 50mLt (0.05Lt) of blood per day (~1%)

* How do you define wound "healing" vs merely wound "closing"?

* Wounds heal shut when stitched after about 10 days.


-- Wound Types --
Incision = cut or slice
Laceration = tear, perhaps from blunt trauma
Abrasion = scrape, superficial usually
Contusion = blunt trauma, internal bleeding
Avulsion = gouging, chunk of tissue removed
Puncture = stabbing or piercing


* Limbs need Health Points to reflect their current relative functionality.

* Maybe head also has Health Points to reflect head-shot autokill?
