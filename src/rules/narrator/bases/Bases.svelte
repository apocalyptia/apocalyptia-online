	<p>Use Build by default and Science for those marked * to install these Features. Each roll represents 1 day of work. Reduce the Featureâ€™s # by your result to set the new # for the next day. The Parts cost is = #. The Parts cost is ignored if the Feature is being relocated. If Characters cooperate, they all roll at once but only the best roll is used, unless someone Botches.</p>
