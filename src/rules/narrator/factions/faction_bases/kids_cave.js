        <p>When The End came, many small children suddenly became orphans. With no one to raise them and danger all around, a lot of these kids survived by running into the wilderness to hide in large cave networks. Those who made it long enough to find other runaways quickly formed little tribes. The tribe offers safety and companionship, and so the children are fanatically loyal to each other. The older kids are the leaders, teachers, and primary warriors. One kid, usually the oldest and biggest boy, takes the role of chief by persuasion or force. The little ones form tiny hunting packs to catch squirrels, frogs, and other small animals. Their communication consists of baby words, grunts, whistles, and funny noises. Only 1 in 3 can speak clearly with a reasonable vocabulary, and only 1 in 10 is functionally literate. If a tribe lasts for many years, the oldest kids may be ostracized by the young ones and forced out of the tribe. When encountering adults, they tend to hide whenever possible. When confrontation is forced, they use deception to set an ambush and use swarm tactics to overwhelm intruders. Adults who kill children suffer -1 Psyche regardless of the justification. If food is very scarce or difficult to acquire, Feral Kids sometimes turn to cannibalism.</p>
