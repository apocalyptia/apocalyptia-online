        <p>Society has forced out the sick amongst them to protect the populace from becoming infected for eons. This practice is ancient and cruel, but absolutely necessary when no adequate medical treatment is available. When a lot of ill people are cast out, they band together for mutual support. Often an exile colony will form within walking distance of the Settlement from which the occupants originated. This way the colony maintains its numbers as the sick continue to die and the newly ill are then cast out in turn. Exile colonies are left alone by humans and animals alike, so their need for defenses is usually minimal. Those exiles who manage to maintain their sanity in the face of such despair will take care of their less fortunate compatriots, hoping that someone will be so kind to them when their own cases progress. Exiles who grow bitter and angry from their plight sometimes prowl the roads looking to rob and murder healthy people. Many will take a middle path, not wasting their energy to help others, but not turning so hateful as to lash out violently. These tend to sit at crossroads and bridges, begging for food and water from passers-by with elaborate (often false) sad stories designed to pluck at the heartstrings and turn guilt into charity. There is no leadership or organizational structure in an exile colony. There are no long term goals because they have no long term. However, once in a while, a lucky person may overcome their illness and leave the colony, provided that they can manage to escape before being killed by jealous exiles. The home Settlement is understandably unlikely to accept them back into the fold, and so these people find themselves exiled once again, this time completely alone.</p>
