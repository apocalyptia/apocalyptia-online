        <p>Decades of institutional racism in the private housing sector, including segregationist public housing policies, has resulted in urban neighborhoods that look more like prison complexes than residential communities. Though these places were socially engineered poverty traps before The End, now they serve as pre-fortified strongholds surrounded by an entire city's worth of resources. The projects are built from brick and cinder block, with heavy steel doors, iron fences, and barred or boarded up windows. The local gangs take control as soon as the police flee, claiming city buses for use as mobile walls on the streets. People of all ages and ethnic backgrounds are forced to find a way to survive in claustrophobic proximity to each other. Gangstas use fast street bikes to make supply runs into other parts of the city. Essential needs are relatively easily met for a time in concentrated urban environments with store shelves stocked with goods. Scavengers often return with expensive luxuries that they never could have afforded before. Prostitution and drug abuse are as common as ever. Sometimes organized boxing matches are held for entertainment and conflict resolution. Respect and loyalty are everything here. The leadership usually consists of a strong front-man who may or may not listen to the advice and wishes of his lieutenants and elders in the community. Outsiders are viewed with extreme suspicion and trespassing is not tolerated.</p>
