        <p>Cannibal “families” like to set up their dens in old slaughterhouses or similar industrial food processing facilities were they can corral their human herd like cattle. They hang their living victims from hooks, cut off pieces when they get hungry, and cauterize the wounds to keep them alive. To pass the time, they compete in bare-knuckle fist-fights and similar tests of fortitude. When not fighting or hunting, they torture their captured prey both physically and psychologically. It is common for Cannibals to force their victims to eat the flesh of their friends, which fills the Cannibals with sadistic glee. Cannibals make jewelry, clothing, and masks from the remains of their victims. They decorate their den with bones, skins, and hair. There is always an Alpha Male who commands the rest of the pack, and a handful of Beta Males who fight each other for position. Women are almost never found in leadership roles and are usually treated like property of the Alpha Male. Over time, Cannibals begin to behave more like feral beasts than human beings. They sometimes forgo language altogether and simply grunt and growl at each other, using violence to clarify their intentions when necessary. Any Cannibal who shows any signs of weakness will be killed and eaten by the others. To prove their strength and make themselves appear more fierce, they ceremonially scar themselves after each kill, file their teeth and fingernails into points, and use their victim's blood as warpaint. Cannibals have no hesitation or fear. Instead, they fly into a rage and mindlessly attack until the threat is destroyed. Because of this lack of strategy or even basic self-preservation, Cannibal families never last very long against well armed opponents with a good strategy in mind.</p>
