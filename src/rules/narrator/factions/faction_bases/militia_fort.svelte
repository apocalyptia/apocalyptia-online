        <p>When the world fell apart, most people in the military examined their priorities and decided to go AWOL and head home to protect their families. They carried off as much as they could as they left. Shortly thereafter, organized anti-government Militias swooped in to take these high value bases. Having prepared for a bloody Second American Revolution years in advance, they had mapped out their domestic military targets and developed attack plans long before anyone knew The End was nigh. The biggest surprise was lack of any serious resistance, and most of those few soldiers who remained at their posts gladly joined up with the Militia. Most Militia members were veterans in one war or another, and so they knew how to operate the equipment and make use of the resources at hand. With strong barbwire fences and watchtowers with mounted machine gun emplacements on all sides, these military bases make nearly ideal Wasteland fortresses. Though ammo is running relatively low, and Food and Water sources are basically non-existent, there is a massive arsenal of high-grade weaponry that deserters simply didn't have the time or space to take with them. As long as the paramilitary chain-of-command holds together, the Militia will remain a fighting force to be reckoned with.</p>
