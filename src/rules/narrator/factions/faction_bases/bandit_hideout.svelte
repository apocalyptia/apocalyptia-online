        <p>Bandits tend to find a good ambush point near a Settlement from which they can bushwhack unsuspecting travelers. Well armed travelers are usually allowed to pass without any harassment. They often make temporary camps underneath bridges or overpasses to extract “tolls”. The price is always the same, half of everything, and they pick which half. They do this for two reasons. In the first place, they generally are not murderers. Bandits are human beings and most of them are not psychopathic and so they avoid wholesale slaughter so that they can sleep with themselves at night. The second reason is one of utility. If Bandits get the reputation that they will let people walk away with their lives and half of their stuff, the victims are much less likely to fight like their lives depend on it. In short, a reputation for mercy increases the likelihood of compliance. They rely on good hiding places with traps and suspended hammocks to keep them safe from intruders. If the perimeter is breached, they can run out the other side or dive in the river to escape. Bandits move to a new hideout every few days and rarely stay long after a hold-up for fear of reprisal. Bandits are cowardly by nature but they do tend to stake out a territory for themselves in a geographic region. Only the most defensible and strategically advantageous ambush points would ever be considered for a permanent Base. There is usually one strong, relatively clever, gang leader followed by a small group of imbeciles waiting for their chance to take control.</p>
