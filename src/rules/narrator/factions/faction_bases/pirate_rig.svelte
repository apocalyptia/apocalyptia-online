        <p>When The End came, the waterways once again became the fastest, safest, and most reliable mode of transportation. As Raiders pillage the land, Pirates rove the seas. Small crews in fast boats overwhelm large oil tankers holding millions of gallons of petroleum. Captured coastal oil drilling rigs serve as man-made island bases with an almost endless fountain of Fuel, with a little makeshift refining, of course. Jet skis, speed boats, and catamarans were converted into light boarding craft with mounted machine guns and grapple lines. Rivers present a huge risk to Pirates, lacking much room to maneuver, but remain very tempting since major cities were built along waterways. Pirate crews are greedy but they tend to want to stay small, preferring to outrun rather than out-gun serious foes. They can be very disorganized but still capable of coordinated extreme violence. Any degree of regimentation is due solely to the iron grip of a respected brutal captain. A wise captain keeps their crew on a short leash. A challenge to the captain's authority is met with immediate single combat. Prisoners are kept as slaves and sometimes sold to inland Traders. Pirates do not care about causes, but those who are smart enough to have any foresight dread the day that the Fuel runs out and they are left totally at the mercy of wind and wave. Most of them are simple hedonists who see nothing left to life but to drink every last bit of pleasure from the world before they all die terrible deaths. Greater force is all that they respect.</p>
