        <p>Mercenaries are countermeasures to Bandits, Raiders, and the like. Ex-soldiers find their way into Mercenary companies to make a living with their skills, finding a sense of camaraderie that was lost when the military collapsed. These companies are organized in a paramilitary style with an established chain-of-command. Mercs are usually employed by a Settlement or a wealthy Trader as gate or caravan guards. The standard contract guarantees Food and Water for each day of service, a weekly ammo allotment, Fuel (if necessary), medical care, and looting rights. Mercs with high reputation can demand a premium, usually involving Alcohol, Luxury Items, and/or Hookers. Mercs build their compounds as small fortresses within big Settlements where they hoard combat gear. Nobody but Mercs, customers, and Hookers get inside. Their is no ideology driving them except a vague notion of honor in doing their job. To say that these men are jaded would be a serious understatement of the depths of cynicism into which they have fallen. It is a common occurrence for a Merc to flip out and go on a shooting spree or simply turn a gun on himself. They may seem like black-humored hedonists, but deep down these are broken men.</p>
