        <p>Barbarians build log castles with motes and palisades deep in the forests on hilltops that allow for a clear view of the sprawling countryside. The huge wooden gate is kept shut and barred unless someone is entering or exiting the castle, and then only with the King's blessing. The strict social class hierarchy goes as follows: King, Duke, Earl, Baron, Knight, Yeoman, Serf. The King can promote or demote anyone to any station at his whim. A high ideal of chivalry is the guiding ethic to “Barbarian” communities. Everyone has a place in the pecking order, which comes with privileges and responsibilities. Challenges to superiors are dealt with by single combat, though only in the most egregious breaches of etiquette is a duel to the death merited. Crimes are punished in a brutal medieval style. Industrial technology of any kind is banned in the King's realm. The ground outside the wall is filled with covered pitfalls and chevaux-de-frise, save one winding invisible path that only the locals know. The walls are guarded day and night by squads of Yeoman archers. Mounted Knights patrol the King's lands daily. Intruders who come peacefully are brought before the King to bend the knee or face his summary judgment. The woodlands and pasture outside the walls are hunted and farmed with traditional methods by the Serfs. The Serfs work in return for food, shelter, protection, and leadership. They store as much Food as possible and live day to day with a constant siege mentality.</p>
