        <p>Preppers come in all shapes and sizes from many backgrounds and belief systems, but most of them are white middle-class conservative male Christians with traditionalist values and strong anti-government political views. Some paranoid preppers with means and determination buried shipping containers on their remote land, or refurbished the Cold War-era bomb shelters beneath their suburban homes, and stocked them with provisions for the coming collapse well before The End finally came. These bunkers are cramped spartan living quarters designed to keep a few families and/or a small group of friends alive for up to a year. Preppers barely qualify as a Faction since they refuse all recruits and have no desire to impose their agenda on others. These people are strict isolationists who hold their families as their highest priority. They have no interest in joining or even making contact with Militias or any other Faction, no matter how closely their ideologies may align, unless absolutely necessary. They fear that such entanglements would only pull their time and resources away from their families, and possibly expose their position to Raiders and the like. Despite their desire for self-sufficiency, they are living on borrowed time. Resources are finite. One day their larder will run dry and they will be forced to reenter society.</p>
