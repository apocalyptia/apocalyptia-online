        <p>As civilization collapsed, a lucky few found themselves in possession of a great deal of barter goods. Maybe they were store managers, local politicians, or just the only person around who happened to have a gun at the time. One way or the other, when law and order fell apart, they became instantly rich. With a good bit of cautious recruitment and clever manipulation, they were able to surround themselves with Mercenaries, Scavengers, and other hangers-on who recognized the long-term perks of an organized business operation. When a Trader becomes wealthy enough to maintain a company, they fortify “Big Box” stores or fulfillment warehouses that still hold large quantities of valuable goods. The entrances are often blocked with vehicles and shipping containers. Armed guards stand watch on the roof and walk patrols around the parking lot. Semi-trucks come and go, bringing newly scavenged loot and taking surplus inventory to be bartered with surrounding Settlements and wandering survivors. Manual labor is done by Slaves who are kept in cages like animals. They are frequently starved and worked literally to death. The Trader rules as a petty dictator. When the number of Slaves gets too high to control, the Trader will promote and sell tickets to gladiator games in the parking lot. Bored settlers come from all around to take in the bloody spectacle from atop high school bleachers as they gobble down concessions. When two powerful rival Traders expand into each others’ territories, turf wars and hostile takeovers are highly likely. If this misunderstanding can be smoothed over with clever negotiation, a cartel may be formed. If Traders have any long-term plans for shaping the future of society, it is bound to look like some kind of Ayn Rand inspired hyper-Capitalist nightmare.</p>
