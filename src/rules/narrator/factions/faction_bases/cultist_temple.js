        <p>Almost anyone under the right set of circumstances can be manipulated into joining a cult. Cult leaders prey on people's innermost weaknesses and offer them a feeling of belonging, of love, and the relief of leaving all problems up to someone else to solve. Sometimes a cult leader will run recruitment campaigns, usually involving kidnapping followed by intense brainwashing. Otherwise they are simply looking for human sacrifices. For those who are brought into the fold, sociopathic degradation, circular mystical philosophy, ritualistic sexual abuse, and addictive psychoactive drugs keep anyone from stepping out of line. Old cathedrals are ideal bases of operations for cults, offering the perfect combination of structural fortifications and theatrical aesthetic grandeur. Many cults take up residence in rural towns surrounded by forests and hills. The cult leader creates and constantly reinforces a narrative of a fallen world undergoing a final divine judgment, with the leader boldly positioning himself as a prophet and lone guide to the path of spiritual redemption. The leader claims to speak directly to and for God almighty. His followers obey every word without question or hesitation. Their individuality has been totally consumed by their holy mission. These followers insist that they are there of their own free will. They will do anything to return to their cult if taken away.</p>
