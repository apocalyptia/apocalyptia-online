        <p>Young punks and assorted homeless kids from big cities decided to hunker down and make their own way when society broke apart around them. For them, living on the margins and picking scraps from dumpsters was was a lifestyle choice long before The End. They spent years developing DIY skills hoping to liberate themselves, if only in a small way, from the system they so deeply hated. Many of them had clashed with riot police at countless protests where they learned how to evade and protect themselves from stronger, better equipped enemies. They had often waxed poetic about how they looked forward to the systemâ€™s inevitable collapse. It was no surprise to them when society finally fell. They occupied subway tunnels and sewer systems and converted them into makeshift bomb shelters. Living underground offers protection and safe passageways throughout a city. Scavenging and urban gardening keeps them fed. Many of them are strict vegans. Most of them love to drink and set up beer brewing operations if possible. Most of them don't have experience with guns, so they fight with homemade weapons. Their tunnels are heavily booby-trapped, which works well for them, since nobody ever wants to commit to standing watch. Decision making is theoretically all done by consensus, which can easily devolve into yelling matches. Though they freely squabble and fight amongst themselves, they rise together at startling speed to face an outside threat as a united front. Slavers are top priority targets. Their most serious punishment for their own members is exile, and so the worst of the Punks lurk around the surrounding area looking for a chance at revenge.</p>
