        <p>Biker gangs turned into modern day Viking war-clans after society collapsed and the deterrent of the rule of law faded into memory. These cold-hearted killers ride across the Wasteland taking whatever or whoever they want. Self-gratification is their only drive. They will torture and kill someone for a laugh as soon as look at them. These men are as psychopathic as people can be while still being capable of teamwork. The gang leader is the strongest and meanest of the group. Anyone who challenges and kills him will become the new leader. Raiders are nomadic by nature. They claim a large region as their territory and are constantly on the move within it. A smart leader will prevent their men from killing everyone in a Settlement so that he can set up a protection racket to get paid regular tribute. Their bases are temporary, though they may return to a good base on their next trip through the neighborhood. They regularly stay at roadside motels for their remoteness, large and often fenced in parking lots, and plenty of beds. A fifth of the gang is ordered to stay awake at any given time to keep watch. If anyone approaches, the lookouts sound the alarm and all the Raiders roll out of bed and turn the parking lot into a shooting gallery. If things go sideways, they can quickly jump on their motorcycles and flee the kill-zone. Raiders are never concerned with honor or bravery. They are opportunistic killers who seek the highest payoff for the lowest risk. Only the most well-fortified Settlements have any chance of warding off a large Raider gang attack.</p>
