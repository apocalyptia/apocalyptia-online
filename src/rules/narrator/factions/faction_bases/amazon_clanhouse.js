        <p>Amazons prefer to fortify large houses in what once where upscale gated communities. They seal the gates and post hand-painted warning signs about the “Plague Inside” or similar warnings and leave a few rotten corpses around the front to sell the ruse. The main clan house has a large steel fence protecting the perimeter of the yard. Scout patrols maintain radio contact with the Base and draw away male intruders. Hidden look-outs and sharpshooters are positioned at strategic choke points in the neighborhood but only fire if necessary. Women who approach without men are greeted with caution and brought in to receive assistance and a possible offer to join the clan. Every woman gets self-defense training but only those with real combat experience before The End, or those who have since proven themselves, are allowed to go on supply and scouting runs. The rest of the clan performs daily maintenance on the houses and gardens to keep up a comfortable life for all residents. All major decisions are discussed until consensus is reached by all clan sisters present. There is ongoing debate about how they can rebuild society without men there to help reproduce the next generation of human beings.</p>
