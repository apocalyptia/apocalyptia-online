    `If opposed parties are willing to talk out their differences, each side start with a list of demands. Roll [Socialize vs Socialize] once per demand. Attitude and situational modifiers should be applied by the GN. Success means you get your demand and the opposed negotiator concedes. Either side can choose to concede a demand without rolling. Some desires may be non-negotiable.`
