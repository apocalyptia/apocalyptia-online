Prepared Actions resolve before other Actions in the order that they are triggered. You may choose to abandon a Prepared Action at any time prior to the turn on which it triggers, at which point you are committed to taking the Prepared Action. If you are still waiting with a Prepared Action on your next turn, the AP you already spent on the Prepared Action does not refresh, but you can continue holding that Prepared Action.`
