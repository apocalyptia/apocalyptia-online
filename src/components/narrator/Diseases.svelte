    <p>Below is a short list of diseases that are likely to appear as major plagues in an Apocalyptia game.</p>
    <p>Transmission is the method by which the disease spreads. Roll Constitution vs Virulence to avoid infection when exposed.</p>
    <p>An attendant caring for a patient must roll Medicine vs the disease’s Diagnose to figure out if there is an effective Treatment and how to apply it. Attendants must roll Luck vs Contagion to avoid exposing themselves to some Diseases while Treating their patients. If their Luck roll Fails, they have been exposed and must roll Constitution vs Virulence to avoid infection. Diseases are considered “toxins” for the purposes of GEAR bonuses.</p>
