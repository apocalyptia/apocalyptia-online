    <p>When the Team has to leave the relative safety of their Base or Settlement to accomplish a goal in the Wasteland, this is called a Mission. The GN should make AREA and ENCOUNTER rolls periodically to keep things interesting. Scenarios give a minimum rate for ENCOUNTER rolls to occur. This is an ideal time to introduce new Characters. There are three basic types of Missions:</p>

    <div id="TravelMissionSec" class="Sec3">
        <p>The Team must move a considerable distance, out in the open, away from the relative safety of their Base and familiar surroundings. Use Marching Speed [Speed /2mph] of the slowest Team member to determine distance per hour. Use Survival(Navigate) 1/day vs Ecosystem # to stay on course.</p>

            <p>When traveling on foot, formations may be called by Team leaders with a Team of at least four members. While in formation, Team members maintain a distance of about 15yds from each other. Every formation has inherent advantages and disadvantages that are applied to all Team members as long as they hold the formation. Whenever a Team member breaks formation, they are no longer effected by formation modifiers.</p>

A Failure convinces the Character that there is nothing left of value in the AREA. Specific AREAS have Perception # and Loot quantities listed in their Notes.</p>

When meeting new Extras, the Character (if meeting individually) or the Team leader (if meeting collectively), rolls Socialize vs Socialize to establish a First Impression. The degree of Success or Failure acts as a modifier to the Extra's Attitude for subsequent social rolls during that exchange. See HUMANS in Ch:5 for typical Attitude modifiers. The Team's reputation in another Settlement or Faction may cause further modifiers if the Extra has heard of the Team.</p>
