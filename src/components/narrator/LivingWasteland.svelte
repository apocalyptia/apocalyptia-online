    <p>Human beings face many threats to their continued survival, most of which involve deprivation of NEEDS. These threats can be broadly categorized and prioritized by how quickly they may lead to an individual or Team’s demise.</p>
    <p>Players must learn to be mindful of the hierarchy of SURVIVAL THREATS to their Characters’ existence and plan their actions accordingly. This hierarchy should be used as a guide when budgeting the Team’s resources, especially when allocating time.</p>
    <p>A useful method to organize the Team's day-to-day activities is to split every day up into four 6hr blocks. Night (0000-0600), Morning (0600-1200), Afternoon (1200-1800), and Evening (1800-2400). This way the Team can budget their time when they have the luxury of planning their lives in hours rather than seconds. Team activities beyond simple combat can be broken up into two broad categories, Mission and Preparation.</p>
