    <h2>Dice Rules</h2>
    <div id="DiceRulesSec" class="Sec2">
        <p>When a Player wants their Character to attempt a difficult task, dice are used to decide a fair outcome. Players should think fast and give brief descriptions to maintain the survival-horror atmosphere. If a Player takes too long, the GN should skip them.</p>
        <p>Players should also keep in mind that they are members of a Team. Taking advantage of the mechanics that allow cooperative play will increase the Characters' chances of survival. This empowers the Team to be much greater collectively than the sum of its parts.</p>
        <p>Most rolls are made using just one six-sided die (“d6”). The way you calculate the Result of a d6 roll is as follows:</p>
        <p>[d6 roll + (Trait, Instinct, or Skill) + modifiers = Result]</p>
        <p>When rolling on a table d66 or d666 is often used. This means you must roll two or three d6s, one for each number column.</p>
        <button id="DifficultyBtn" class="Btn">DIFFICULTY (#):</button>
        <div id="DifficultySec" class="Sec3">
            <p>This is how hard it is to perform a task. The Result of your die roll must equal or exceed this number in order to be successful. Difficulty numbers are indicated with the # symbol. The GN sets the # and gives modifiers when appropriate. The players add their relevant modifiers to their roll to get a Result. If a roll is opposed by another roll, re-roll any ties.</p>
        </div>
        <button id="SuccessBtn" class="Btn">SUCCESS (S):</button>
        <div id="SuccessSec" class="Sec3">
            <p>Achieving a result that meets or beats a Difficulty (#) is called a Success. Re-roll any ties if making an opposed roll. Players are responsible for keeping track of any ongoing modifiers (bonuses and penalties) that are affecting their Character’s ability to perform actions.</p>
            <p><span class="Heading2">Automatic Success:</span> If your bonus alone is greater than the # and circumstances are calm, you Succeed without rolling.</p>
            <p><span class="Heading2">Cooperation:</span> If Characters want to help each other perform a task, they all roll at once but only the best roll is used, unless someone Botches (see below) in which case the Botch is used.</p>
        </div>
        <button id="FailBtn" class="Btn">FAIL (F):</button>
        <div id="FailSec" class="Sec3">
            <p>When the result is  less than the #, your attempt did not work. This usually is not catastrophic but rather just a temporary inconvenience.</p>
        </div>
        <button id="ExplodeBtn" class="Btn">EXPLODE (6):</button>
        <div id="ExplodeSec" class="Sec3">
            <p>When 6 comes up on a d6 roll, roll it again and again as long as 6's continue. This is called Exploding. Add each roll together, then add modifiers to get your Result.</p>
            <p>For example, if your ATK roll is 6, then another 6, then a 1, your ATK result will be 13 + your Skill (say 3) + bonuses (say +1) for a Result of 17. This ATK will hit an enemy with a DEF 16 or less.</p>
            <p>You get a bonus to DMG equal to the amount by which your ATK exceeds the target’s DEF. So on a Successful attack, DMG = Weapon DMG + (ATK – DEF). See Ch:2 for Combat.</p>
        </div>
        <button id="BotchBtn" class="Btn">BOTCH (1):</button>
        <div id="BotchSec" class="Sec3">
            <p>If you roll 1, re-roll to check for a Botch. If 1 is rolled again, you Fail very badly. Any other roll just means you have a 1 plus whatever other modifiers apply to that roll. You do not Botch on Exploding rolls. Skills usually list their Botch effects. The GN may add more negative effects depending on the circumstances around the Botch. Every time you Botch, you get +1XP.</p>
