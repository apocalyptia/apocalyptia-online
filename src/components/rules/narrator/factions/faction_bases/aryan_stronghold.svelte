        <p>White supremacist gangs were among the most powerful criminal organizations within the prison system before The End. When the guards left them all to starve in their cells, they had no option but to find a way out. Once a few got out, they began freeing some of the others. The Aryans culled the non-white population down to a manageable number and then forced them into slavery. With the prison under their control, they had no reason to leave their mighty fortress. The walls were nearly impenetrable and they had enough beds to make the cell blocks into a barracks to house the white army they intended to build. They organized raiding parties to bring back supplies and slaves as necessary. The yards were converted into forced-labor farms. As the word got out that neo-Nazis were assembling an army of European-descended warriors to “purify” the world, racist militant groups flocked to join the cause. With greater numbers came greater organization and so the army evolved from a Klan-like lynch-mob into something more closely resembling the Fourth Reich. By their reasoning, since the population has plummeted and there is no government left to protect the wretched dregs of society, it should be relatively easy to build a powerful Fascist state that will institute eugenics breeding programs and extermination camps to clean out genetic impurities and bring about a super race for a whiter and therefore brighter tomorrow. The depths of the psychopathy that permeates such an organization cannot be overstated and should never be underestimated. They have made a religion of pure hatred.</p>
