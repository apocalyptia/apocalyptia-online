        <p>Hippies thrive in the arms of nature, depending on plants for nearly all of their needs. They join to form consensus-based collectivist communities that rely on farming and foraging for sustenance. They often spend their time wandering in the woods, practicing yoga, and taking copious amounts of naturally occurring psychedelic drugs. Their remote location keeps them safe from the dangers of big cities, but eventually trouble always finds them. Their plan in such cases is always evasion, stealth, or diplomacy. Even if they were capable of fighting, they would avoid it for ethical reasons. They are total pacifists, seeking peace through non-violent solutions in all circumstances. If a potentially life-threatening situation cannot be resolved through discussion or avoidance, they would rather die than commit a violent act, even in self-defense. Their unwavering faith in the innate goodness of all human beings makes them the perfect victims for deception and abuse. It is common for a commune, once it has been discovered, to be regularly extorted for protection tribute by marauding Raider gangs. Wranglers may come through now and then to kidnap slaves, though they leave most of the commune intact to attract more survivors to be enslaved later. In peaceful meetings with outsiders, Hippies offer natural drugs, medical care, and fresh Food and Water as barter for Fuel, equipment, or a work-trade. They are kind, caring people who believe in radical freedom and free love. They do no turn away anyone in need. Some of them are dreamy-eyed “burn outs” barely capable of forming coherent thoughts. Others are sharp industrious people who care deeply about the Earth and all living things.</p>
