        <p>Believing the oppressive and decadent Capitalist system to be either the direct cause of (or at least a catalyst for) The End, these radical leftist revolutionaries want to build a worker's utopia on the rubble of the old system. To this end, they have organized a people's army supported by democratically controlled working groups to secure a region to begin creating a new and better. Guerrillas use naturally occurring fortifications to their advantage whenever possible. They build their command centers within large cave networks in remote mountains. Often the main base is a hub with camouflaged look-out positions stretching out in all directions, linked to the center by tunnels or hidden trails. Booby-traps are everywhere in Guerrilla territory. Despite the sophisticated defensive systems in place, Guerrilla camps are designed to be folded up and moved along at a moment's notice. Guerrillas choose their battles with extreme caution and careful planning. They do not willingly engage an enemy unless they have an overwhelming advantage. Following in the Marxist rebel tradition, Guerrillas distribute their resources on the basis of need while tasks are assigned on the basis of ability. Sexism and racism are not tolerated. Slavers are actively hunted and shown no mercy. Operational security is of the highest importance and so recruitment is a slow, sometimes paranoid process involving a great deal of deception and mind-games to get at the core of a candidate's true values. Guerrilla armies are led by either a strong militant leader or a council of commanders.</p>
