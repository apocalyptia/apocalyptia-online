<button id='FactionsBtn' class='Btn'>FACTIONS</button>
<div id='FactionsSec' class='Sec2'>
	<p>People in the Wasteland seek out survivors who look, act, and think like they do. There is safety in numbers. Factions form along demographic and ideological lines which often results in homogeneous tribes. Some Factions can work together. Others are mortal enemies. Convincing these Factions to reconcile their differences and cooperate with each other will be critical in order to save humanity. Joining a Faction requires good will, proven devotion, and taking the Allegiance Ability. There are fifteen major Faction types in the Wasteland. They interact as follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Cautious: Receptive to cooperation but always alert.</li>
		<li>Distrustful: Highly suspicious but not instantly hostile.</li>
		<li>Aggressive: Eager to fight under almost any circumstances.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The table below shows how the Factions in the left column typically feel about the Factions on the top row. Higher numbers indicate worse relations. These feelings are not always reciprocal. Some Factions are natural allies, while others are sworn enemies. Changing these prejudices requires time, effort, and wisdom.</p>

Leaders can split their Faction into Cells to perform multiple Strategies simultaneously, but a commander must be appointed to make the Leadership rolls for each new Cell. The Cells’ Traits are recalculated by their Population. The Faction or Cell with the smallest Population acts first.</p>

				<p>Amazons prefer to fortify large houses in what once where upscale gated communities. They seal the gates and post hand-painted warning signs about the “Plague Inside” or similar warnings and leave a few rotten corpses around the front to sell the ruse. The main clan house has a large steel fence protecting the perimeter of the yard. Scout patrols maintain radio contact with the Base and draw away male intruders. Hidden look-outs and sharpshooters are positioned at strategic choke points in the neighborhood but only fire if necessary. Women who approach without men are greeted with caution and brought in to receive assistance and a possible offer to join the clan. Every woman gets self-defense training but only those with real combat experience before The End, or those who have since proven themselves, are allowed to go on supply and scouting runs. The rest of the clan performs daily maintenance on the houses and gardens to keep up a comfortable life for all residents. All major decisions are discussed until consensus is reached by all clan sisters present. There is ongoing debate about how they can rebuild society without men there to help reproduce the next generation of human beings.</p>

				<p>White supremacist gangs were among the most powerful criminal organizations within the prison system before The End. When the guards left them all to starve in their cells, they had no option but to find a way out. Once a few got out, they began freeing some of the others. The Aryans culled the non-white population down to a manageable number and then forced them into slavery. With the prison under their control, they had no reason to leave their mighty fortress. The walls were nearly impenetrable and they had enough beds to make the cell blocks into a barracks to house the white army they intended to build. They organized raiding parties to bring back supplies and slaves as necessary. The yards were converted into forced-labor farms. As the word got out that neo-Nazis were assembling an army of European-descended warriors to “purify” the world, racist militant groups flocked to join the cause. With greater numbers came greater organization and so the army evolved from a Klan-like lynch-mob into something more closely resembling the Fourth Reich. By their reasoning, since the population has plummeted and there is no government left to protect the wretched dregs of society, it should be relatively easy to build a powerful Fascist state that will institute eugenics breeding programs and extermination camps to clean out genetic impurities and bring about a super race for a whiter and therefore brighter tomorrow. The depths of the psychopathy that permeates such an organization cannot be overstated and should never be underestimated. They have made a religion of pure hatred.</p>

				<p>Bandits tend to find a good ambush point near a Settlement from which they can bushwhack unsuspecting travelers. Well armed travelers are usually allowed to pass without any harassment. They often make temporary camps underneath bridges or overpasses to extract “tolls”. The price is always the same, half of everything, and they pick which half. They do this for two reasons. In the first place, they generally are not murderers. Bandits are human beings and most of them are not psychopathic and so they avoid wholesale slaughter so that they can sleep with themselves at night. The second reason is one of utility. If Bandits get the reputation that they will let people walk away with their lives and half of their stuff, the victims are much less likely to fight like their lives depend on it. In short, a reputation for mercy increases the likelihood of compliance. They rely on good hiding places with traps and suspended hammocks to keep them safe from intruders. If the perimeter is breached, they can run out the other side or dive in the river to escape. Bandits move to a new hideout every few days and rarely stay long after a hold-up for fear of reprisal. Bandits are cowardly by nature but they do tend to stake out a territory for themselves in a geographic region. Only the most defensible and strategically advantageous ambush points would ever be considered for a permanent Base. There is usually one strong, relatively clever, gang leader followed by a small group of imbeciles waiting for their chance to take control.</p>

				<p>Barbarians build log castles with motes and palisades deep in the forests on hilltops that allow for a clear view of the sprawling countryside. The huge wooden gate is kept shut and barred unless someone is entering or exiting the castle, and then only with the King's blessing. The strict social class hierarchy goes as follows: King, Duke, Earl, Baron, Knight, Yeoman, Serf. The King can promote or demote anyone to any station at his whim. A high ideal of chivalry is the guiding ethic to “Barbarian” communities. Everyone has a place in the pecking order, which comes with privileges and responsibilities. Challenges to superiors are dealt with by single combat, though only in the most egregious breaches of etiquette is a duel to the death merited. Crimes are punished in a brutal medieval style. Industrial technology of any kind is banned in the King's realm. The ground outside the wall is filled with covered pitfalls and chevaux-de-frise, save one winding invisible path that only the locals know. The walls are guarded day and night by squads of Yeoman archers. Mounted Knights patrol the King's lands daily. Intruders who come peacefully are brought before the King to bend the knee or face his summary judgment. The woodlands and pasture outside the walls are hunted and farmed with traditional methods by the Serfs. The Serfs work in return for food, shelter, protection, and leadership. They store as much Food as possible and live day to day with a constant siege mentality.</p>

				<p>Cannibal “families” like to set up their dens in old slaughterhouses or similar industrial food processing facilities were they can corral their human herd like cattle. They hang their living victims from hooks, cut off pieces when they get hungry, and cauterize the wounds to keep them alive. To pass the time, they compete in bare-knuckle fist-fights and similar tests of fortitude. When not fighting or hunting, they torture their captured prey both physically and psychologically. It is common for Cannibals to force their victims to eat the flesh of their friends, which fills the Cannibals with sadistic glee. Cannibals make jewelry, clothing, and masks from the remains of their victims. They decorate their den with bones, skins, and hair. There is always an Alpha Male who commands the rest of the pack, and a handful of Beta Males who fight each other for position. Women are almost never found in leadership roles and are usually treated like property of the Alpha Male. Over time, Cannibals begin to behave more like feral beasts than human beings. They sometimes forgo language altogether and simply grunt and growl at each other, using violence to clarify their intentions when necessary. Any Cannibal who shows any signs of weakness will be killed and eaten by the others. To prove their strength and make themselves appear more fierce, they ceremonially scar themselves after each kill, file their teeth and fingernails into points, and use their victim's blood as warpaint. Cannibals have no hesitation or fear. Instead, they fly into a rage and mindlessly attack until the threat is destroyed. Because of this lack of strategy or even basic self-preservation, Cannibal families never last very long against well armed opponents with a good strategy in mind.</p>

				<p>Almost anyone under the right set of circumstances can be manipulated into joining a cult. Cult leaders prey on people's innermost weaknesses and offer them a feeling of belonging, of love, and the relief of leaving all problems up to someone else to solve. Sometimes a cult leader will run recruitment campaigns, usually involving kidnapping followed by intense brainwashing. Otherwise they are simply looking for human sacrifices. For those who are brought into the fold, sociopathic degradation, circular mystical philosophy, ritualistic sexual abuse, and addictive psychoactive drugs keep anyone from stepping out of line. Old cathedrals are ideal bases of operations for cults, offering the perfect combination of structural fortifications and theatrical aesthetic grandeur. Many cults take up residence in rural towns surrounded by forests and hills. The cult leader creates and constantly reinforces a narrative of a fallen world undergoing a final divine judgment, with the leader boldly positioning himself as a prophet and lone guide to the path of spiritual redemption. The leader claims to speak directly to and for God almighty. His followers obey every word without question or hesitation. Their individuality has been totally consumed by their holy mission. These followers insist that they are there of their own free will. They will do anything to return to their cult if taken away.</p>

				<p>Society has forced out the sick amongst them to protect the populace from becoming infected for eons. This practice is ancient and cruel, but absolutely necessary when no adequate medical treatment is available. When a lot of ill people are cast out, they band together for mutual support. Often an exile colony will form within walking distance of the Settlement from which the occupants originated. This way the colony maintains its numbers as the sick continue to die and the newly ill are then cast out in turn. Exile colonies are left alone by humans and animals alike, so their need for defenses is usually minimal. Those exiles who manage to maintain their sanity in the face of such despair will take care of their less fortunate compatriots, hoping that someone will be so kind to them when their own cases progress. Exiles who grow bitter and angry from their plight sometimes prowl the roads looking to rob and murder healthy people. Many will take a middle path, not wasting their energy to help others, but not turning so hateful as to lash out violently. These tend to sit at crossroads and bridges, begging for food and water from passers-by with elaborate (often false) sad stories designed to pluck at the heartstrings and turn guilt into charity. There is no leadership or organizational structure in an exile colony. There are no long term goals because they have no long term. However, once in a while, a lucky person may overcome their illness and leave the colony, provided that they can manage to escape before being killed by jealous exiles. The home Settlement is understandably unlikely to accept them back into the fold, and so these people find themselves exiled once again, this time completely alone.</p>

				<p>When The End came, many small children suddenly became orphans. With no one to raise them and danger all around, a lot of these kids survived by running into the wilderness to hide in large cave networks. Those who made it long enough to find other runaways quickly formed little tribes. The tribe offers safety and companionship, and so the children are fanatically loyal to each other. The older kids are the leaders, teachers, and primary warriors. One kid, usually the oldest and biggest boy, takes the role of chief by persuasion or force. The little ones form tiny hunting packs to catch squirrels, frogs, and other small animals. Their communication consists of baby words, grunts, whistles, and funny noises. Only 1 in 3 can speak clearly with a reasonable vocabulary, and only 1 in 10 is functionally literate. If a tribe lasts for many years, the oldest kids may be ostracized by the young ones and forced out of the tribe. When encountering adults, they tend to hide whenever possible. When confrontation is forced, they use deception to set an ambush and use swarm tactics to overwhelm intruders. Adults who kill children suffer -1 Psyche regardless of the justification. If food is very scarce or difficult to acquire, Feral Kids sometimes turn to cannibalism.</p>

				<p>Decades of institutional racism in the private housing sector, including segregationist public housing policies, has resulted in urban neighborhoods that look more like prison complexes than residential communities. Though these places were socially engineered poverty traps before The End, now they serve as pre-fortified strongholds surrounded by an entire city's worth of resources. The projects are built from brick and cinder block, with heavy steel doors, iron fences, and barred or boarded up windows. The local gangs take control as soon as the police flee, claiming city buses for use as mobile walls on the streets. People of all ages and ethnic backgrounds are forced to find a way to survive in claustrophobic proximity to each other. Gangstas use fast street bikes to make supply runs into other parts of the city. Essential needs are relatively easily met for a time in concentrated urban environments with store shelves stocked with goods. Scavengers often return with expensive luxuries that they never could have afforded before. Prostitution and drug abuse are as common as ever. Sometimes organized boxing matches are held for entertainment and conflict resolution. Respect and loyalty are everything here. The leadership usually consists of a strong front-man who may or may not listen to the advice and wishes of his lieutenants and elders in the community. Outsiders are viewed with extreme suspicion and trespassing is not tolerated.</p>

				<p>Believing the oppressive and decadent Capitalist system to be either the direct cause of (or at least a catalyst for) The End, these radical leftist revolutionaries want to build a worker's utopia on the rubble of the old system. To this end, they have organized a people's army supported by democratically controlled working groups to secure a region to begin creating a new and better. Guerrillas use naturally occurring fortifications to their advantage whenever possible. They build their command centers within large cave networks in remote mountains. Often the main base is a hub with camouflaged look-out positions stretching out in all directions, linked to the center by tunnels or hidden trails. Booby-traps are everywhere in Guerrilla territory. Despite the sophisticated defensive systems in place, Guerrilla camps are designed to be folded up and moved along at a moment's notice. Guerrillas choose their battles with extreme caution and careful planning. They do not willingly engage an enemy unless they have an overwhelming advantage. Following in the Marxist rebel tradition, Guerrillas distribute their resources on the basis of need while tasks are assigned on the basis of ability. Sexism and racism are not tolerated. Slavers are actively hunted and shown no mercy. Operational security is of the highest importance and so recruitment is a slow, sometimes paranoid process involving a great deal of deception and mind-games to get at the core of a candidate's true values. Guerrilla armies are led by either a strong militant leader or a council of commanders.</p>

				<p>Hippies thrive in the arms of nature, depending on plants for nearly all of their needs. They join to form consensus-based collectivist communities that rely on farming and foraging for sustenance. They often spend their time wandering in the woods, practicing yoga, and taking copious amounts of naturally occurring psychedelic drugs. Their remote location keeps them safe from the dangers of big cities, but eventually trouble always finds them. Their plan in such cases is always evasion, stealth, or diplomacy. Even if they were capable of fighting, they would avoid it for ethical reasons. They are total pacifists, seeking peace through non-violent solutions in all circumstances. If a potentially life-threatening situation cannot be resolved through discussion or avoidance, they would rather die than commit a violent act, even in self-defense. Their unwavering faith in the innate goodness of all human beings makes them the perfect victims for deception and abuse. It is common for a commune, once it has been discovered, to be regularly extorted for protection tribute by marauding Raider gangs. Wranglers may come through now and then to kidnap slaves, though they leave most of the commune intact to attract more survivors to be enslaved later. In peaceful meetings with outsiders, Hippies offer natural drugs, medical care, and fresh Food and Water as barter for Fuel, equipment, or a work-trade. They are kind, caring people who believe in radical freedom and free love. They do no turn away anyone in need. Some of them are dreamy-eyed “burn outs” barely capable of forming coherent thoughts. Others are sharp industrious people who care deeply about the Earth and all living things.</p>

				<p>Mercenaries are countermeasures to Bandits, Raiders, and the like. Ex-soldiers find their way into Mercenary companies to make a living with their skills, finding a sense of camaraderie that was lost when the military collapsed. These companies are organized in a paramilitary style with an established chain-of-command. Mercs are usually employed by a Settlement or a wealthy Trader as gate or caravan guards. The standard contract guarantees Food and Water for each day of service, a weekly ammo allotment, Fuel (if necessary), medical care, and looting rights. Mercs with high reputation can demand a premium, usually involving Alcohol, Luxury Items, and/or Hookers. Mercs build their compounds as small fortresses within big Settlements where they hoard combat gear. Nobody but Mercs, customers, and Hookers get inside. Their is no ideology driving them except a vague notion of honor in doing their job. To say that these men are jaded would be a serious understatement of the depths of cynicism into which they have fallen. It is a common occurrence for a Merc to flip out and go on a shooting spree or simply turn a gun on himself. They may seem like black-humored hedonists, but deep down these are broken men.</p>

				<p>When the world fell apart, most people in the military examined their priorities and decided to go AWOL and head home to protect their families. They carried off as much as they could as they left. Shortly thereafter, organized anti-government Militias swooped in to take these high value bases. Having prepared for a bloody Second American Revolution years in advance, they had mapped out their domestic military targets and developed attack plans long before anyone knew The End was nigh. The biggest surprise was lack of any serious resistance, and most of those few soldiers who remained at their posts gladly joined up with the Militia. Most Militia members were veterans in one war or another, and so they knew how to operate the equipment and make use of the resources at hand. With strong barbwire fences and watchtowers with mounted machine gun emplacements on all sides, these military bases make nearly ideal Wasteland fortresses. Though ammo is running relatively low, and Food and Water sources are basically non-existent, there is a massive arsenal of high-grade weaponry that deserters simply didn't have the time or space to take with them. As long as the paramilitary chain-of-command holds together, the Militia will remain a fighting force to be reckoned with.</p>

				<p>When The End came, the waterways once again became the fastest, safest, and most reliable mode of transportation. As Raiders pillage the land, Pirates rove the seas. Small crews in fast boats overwhelm large oil tankers holding millions of gallons of petroleum. Captured coastal oil drilling rigs serve as man-made island bases with an almost endless fountain of Fuel, with a little makeshift refining, of course. Jet skis, speed boats, and catamarans were converted into light boarding craft with mounted machine guns and grapple lines. Rivers present a huge risk to Pirates, lacking much room to maneuver, but remain very tempting since major cities were built along waterways. Pirate crews are greedy but they tend to want to stay small, preferring to outrun rather than out-gun serious foes. They can be very disorganized but still capable of coordinated extreme violence. Any degree of regimentation is due solely to the iron grip of a respected brutal captain. A wise captain keeps their crew on a short leash. A challenge to the captain's authority is met with immediate single combat. Prisoners are kept as slaves and sometimes sold to inland Traders. Pirates do not care about causes, but those who are smart enough to have any foresight dread the day that the Fuel runs out and they are left totally at the mercy of wind and wave. Most of them are simple hedonists who see nothing left to life but to drink every last bit of pleasure from the world before they all die terrible deaths. Greater force is all that they respect.</p>

				<p>Preppers come in all shapes and sizes from many backgrounds and belief systems, but most of them are white middle-class conservative male Christians with traditionalist values and strong anti-government political views. Some paranoid preppers with means and determination buried shipping containers on their remote land, or refurbished the Cold War-era bomb shelters beneath their suburban homes, and stocked them with provisions for the coming collapse well before The End finally came. These bunkers are cramped spartan living quarters designed to keep a few families and/or a small group of friends alive for up to a year. Preppers barely qualify as a Faction since they refuse all recruits and have no desire to impose their agenda on others. These people are strict isolationists who hold their families as their highest priority. They have no interest in joining or even making contact with Militias or any other Faction, no matter how closely their ideologies may align, unless absolutely necessary. They fear that such entanglements would only pull their time and resources away from their families, and possibly expose their position to Raiders and the like. Despite their desire for self-sufficiency, they are living on borrowed time. Resources are finite. One day their larder will run dry and they will be forced to reenter society.</p>

				<p>Young punks and assorted homeless kids from big cities decided to hunker down and make their own way when society broke apart around them. For them, living on the margins and picking scraps from dumpsters was was a lifestyle choice long before The End. They spent years developing DIY skills hoping to liberate themselves, if only in a small way, from the system they so deeply hated. Many of them had clashed with riot police at countless protests where they learned how to evade and protect themselves from stronger, better equipped enemies. They had often waxed poetic about how they looked forward to the system’s inevitable collapse. It was no surprise to them when society finally fell. They occupied subway tunnels and sewer systems and converted them into makeshift bomb shelters. Living underground offers protection and safe passageways throughout a city. Scavenging and urban gardening keeps them fed. Many of them are strict vegans. Most of them love to drink and set up beer brewing operations if possible. Most of them don't have experience with guns, so they fight with homemade weapons. Their tunnels are heavily booby-trapped, which works well for them, since nobody ever wants to commit to standing watch. Decision making is theoretically all done by consensus, which can easily devolve into yelling matches. Though they freely squabble and fight amongst themselves, they rise together at startling speed to face an outside threat as a united front. Slavers are top priority targets. Their most serious punishment for their own members is exile, and so the worst of the Punks lurk around the surrounding area looking for a chance at revenge.</p>

				<p>Biker gangs turned into modern day Viking war-clans after society collapsed and the deterrent of the rule of law faded into memory. These cold-hearted killers ride across the Wasteland taking whatever or whoever they want. Self-gratification is their only drive. They will torture and kill someone for a laugh as soon as look at them. These men are as psychopathic as people can be while still being capable of teamwork. The gang leader is the strongest and meanest of the group. Anyone who challenges and kills him will become the new leader. Raiders are nomadic by nature. They claim a large region as their territory and are constantly on the move within it. A smart leader will prevent their men from killing everyone in a Settlement so that he can set up a protection racket to get paid regular tribute. Their bases are temporary, though they may return to a good base on their next trip through the neighborhood. They regularly stay at roadside motels for their remoteness, large and often fenced in parking lots, and plenty of beds. A fifth of the gang is ordered to stay awake at any given time to keep watch. If anyone approaches, the lookouts sound the alarm and all the Raiders roll out of bed and turn the parking lot into a shooting gallery. If things go sideways, they can quickly jump on their motorcycles and flee the kill-zone. Raiders are never concerned with honor or bravery. They are opportunistic killers who seek the highest payoff for the lowest risk. Only the most well-fortified Settlements have any chance of warding off a large Raider gang attack.</p>

				<p>As civilization collapsed, a lucky few found themselves in possession of a great deal of barter goods. Maybe they were store managers, local politicians, or just the only person around who happened to have a gun at the time. One way or the other, when law and order fell apart, they became instantly rich. With a good bit of cautious recruitment and clever manipulation, they were able to surround themselves with Mercenaries, Scavengers, and other hangers-on who recognized the long-term perks of an organized business operation. When a Trader becomes wealthy enough to maintain a company, they fortify “Big Box” stores or fulfillment warehouses that still hold large quantities of valuable goods. The entrances are often blocked with vehicles and shipping containers. Armed guards stand watch on the roof and walk patrols around the parking lot. Semi-trucks come and go, bringing newly scavenged loot and taking surplus inventory to be bartered with surrounding Settlements and wandering survivors. Manual labor is done by Slaves who are kept in cages like animals. They are frequently starved and worked literally to death. The Trader rules as a petty dictator. When the number of Slaves gets too high to control, the Trader will promote and sell tickets to gladiator games in the parking lot. Bored settlers come from all around to take in the bloody spectacle from atop high school bleachers as they gobble down concessions. When two powerful rival Traders expand into each others’ territories, turf wars and hostile takeovers are highly likely. If this misunderstanding can be smoothed over with clever negotiation, a cartel may be formed. If Traders have any long-term plans for shaping the future of society, it is bound to look like some kind of Ayn Rand inspired hyper-Capitalist nightmare.</p>
