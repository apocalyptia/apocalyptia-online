------ DEV PATH ------

finish integrating database (faunadb) with client app
*** Need to figure out netlify lambda function paths
*** Need to figure out query commands
*** Need to figure out how to save Character stringified JSON as a document

finish user auth features (recovery, account settings)
apply ability mods to character
add random gear roll purchasing for xp?
create sorting options for all list pages
make narrator dashboard
make game group functionality
write the combat system methods (based on lambda functions)
make game group chat

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------ TODO LIST ------

UX/UI:
	Change all lime to white and use a filter layer that goes from green>yellow>red to reflect character health.
	Likewise set a blur effect that reflects the character psyche
	Figure out what to do about Tables.
	Make a sidenav menu for table of contents in Rules section.
	Probably also a sidenav for character sheet.

Gear.js:
	Storage: Unit conversions still need work.
	make a new set of general gear attributes: Electronic, Consumable, Wearable
	add fishing line
	add metal cup
	add firelog
	add trauma sheers
	add antiseptic of some kind

Hazards.js:
	Create Hazards file.
	Create Radiation rules.
	Put Falling here.
	Put Burning rule here.
	Put Friendly Fire here.
	Put Needs rules here. Requires some rewording.

Reference:
	Put Expand/Collapse All button on reference.
	Figure out topical organization. Health for example.
	Painkiller required for a night's sleep to Recover?

Markup:
	Add <abbr> tag to all abbreviations. ex: <abbr title="Constitution">C</abbr>

Creator:
	Change Creator routing to SPA style. Make sure character data persists through reloads.
	List Skill (Specialty) and list alpha by Skill. <= Problem here is that the ability becomes part of the character object.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------ BRAINSTORMING ------

- Bonus XP each session? Some is given by Narrator. Some points are allocated by vote by the Team. Some of these are auto-calculated by the system like badges (most damage dealt, move successes, etc)?

Abilities:
	Some kind of CQB Ability allowing you to split Rapid attacks between two targets.

Combat:
	Actions:
		Grappling: What about Submissions? Both Grabbed?
		Work on this more. Finish making separate Grappling-related Maneuvers where relevant. Make advanced Maneuvers conditional by Status more than relying on this staged approach. Add a static bonus (+3) or make opponent Defenseless when they are Grabbed. Defenseless fits an established pattern better I think. Maybe replace other bonuses with Defenseless effect? Some things should stack together though.
		'When you have Succeeded at a Grab, you get a bonus to any ATK made against the grappled opponent equal to your MATK roll - their DEF. If they attempt to escape but fail, readjust your bonus to be your most recent Grapple roll to maintain the grab - their failed escape roll. As an action while grappling, you may attempt to improve your grip and position by making another Melee vs Melee roll with your Success bonus. The result is your new Grapple Difficulty for the enemy to escape. If you fail, the enemy has moved 1 step up on the grapple scale toward escape. A grappled enemy must succeed on a grapple check to move 1 step up the grapple scale. A success while grabbed means escape. A fail readjusts the grapple bonus to be the difference between your roll and the attacker. When you succeed while grabbed, you may forego escape to use your roll to reverse the grapple and grab the attacker instead.'

Character:
	Properties:
		Maybe I should come up with a good way to present Psyche as the mental part of Health, which would be the parent Property. Treat Psyche like a "Mental" Location along with all of the body parts under Health.

	Character Sheet:
		Combine Health with Armor somehow.

Figure out a quick Jury-Rig version of Build.
Social actions multiple times per round?
